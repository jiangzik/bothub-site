# FAQ

## 1. What if download is slow or fails?

- Retry on another network
- Temporarily disable software that may block downloads
- Verify free disk space
- Prefer desktop browsers over restricted in-app browsers

## 2. What if the app does not launch after install?

- On macOS, check Privacy & Security for blocked apps
- On Windows, try launching with admin permission
- On Linux, verify execute permission (especially AppImage)

## 3. Why do I get 401/403 errors?

Your API key is likely invalid, expired, or missing permissions.  
Create a new key and verify project/org binding.

## 4. Why model-not-found or 404?

The model ID in BotHub does not match your provider model name.  
Copy it directly from the provider console.

## 5. Why is response latency sometimes high?

- Provider-side congestion
- A slower model variant
- Large prompt/context size

Use a small test prompt first to validate the pipeline.

## 6. Why do repeated runs give very different outputs?

- Temperature is too high
- Prompt constraints are vague
- Old context from unrelated tasks remains in the same thread

Lower temperature and retry in a fresh thread.

## 7. How to smoke test quickly after an upgrade?

Run these three checks:

1. Simple QA prompt
2. JSON output prompt
3. Long summary prompt

If any fails, switch to backup model to isolate config vs version issues.

## 8. When will iOS be available?

iOS is currently in development. Track updates on the official site and community channels.
