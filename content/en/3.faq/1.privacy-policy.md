# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 13, 2026

BotHub ("we", "us", "our") values your privacy. This policy applies to BotHub apps on Android, iOS, and desktop, as well as the official website.

## 1. Data we may process

We may process:

1. Data you provide directly: chat content, prompts, model settings, backup settings, and related inputs.
2. Files and media you choose to provide: such as images, attachments, and backup files.
3. Device and app information: app version, crash/error logs, and basic device metadata for troubleshooting and stability.
4. Network and service configuration: provider endpoints and third-party API configuration entered by you.

## 2. Why we process data

We process data to:

1. Deliver core features (chat, model requests, settings, sync, and backup).
2. Troubleshoot issues and improve reliability and security.
3. Improve product usability and overall experience.

## 3. Local storage and optional sync

1. BotHub is local-first by default.
2. You may optionally enable sync/backup features (for example WebDAV, S3, or other services you configure). Data is sent according to your configuration.
3. You can delete conversations and local data in the app, or disable related features.

## 4. Third-party services and transfers

1. When you use model features, requests are sent to the provider you choose or configure (for example OpenAI-compatible services, Anthropic, Google, and others).
2. When you use web search or web fetch features, requests are sent to the selected services.
3. Third-party data handling is governed by their own privacy policies.

## 5. Mobile permissions

On Android/iOS, BotHub may request:

1. Camera access: to capture photos for messages.
2. Photo library/storage access: to pick and import media or files.
3. Microphone access: for voice input features when enabled.

You can revoke permissions at any time in system settings, but related features may stop working.

## 6. Sharing and disclosure

1. We do not sell your personal data.
2. Data is disclosed only when necessary to provide user-initiated features, comply with legal obligations, or protect platform/user safety.

## 7. Data retention

1. Local data is generally kept until you delete it.
2. Data sent to third-party providers follows each provider's retention policy.

## 8. Children

If you are under the age required to provide valid consent in your jurisdiction, use BotHub under parent/guardian supervision.

## 9. Policy updates

We may update this policy based on product or regulatory changes. The latest version will be published on this page with an updated "Last updated" date.
