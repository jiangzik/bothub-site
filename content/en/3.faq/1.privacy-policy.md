# Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 27, 2026

BotHub ("we", "us", "our") values your privacy. This policy applies to BotHub apps on Android, iOS, and desktop, as well as the official website.

## 1. Data usage commitment

We do not use any of your data.

This means we do not collect, read, upload, store, analyze, share, or sell your chat content, files, settings, API keys, or other user data.

## 2. Local data principle

1. BotHub is local-first.
2. Your conversation and configuration data stay on your own device by default.
3. You can delete local data at any time.

## 3. Third-party model and network services

1. When you use model or network features, requests are sent directly from your device to the third-party provider you choose or configure.
2. We do not act as a relay server, and we do not receive or retain your request content.
3. Third-party data handling is governed by each provider's own privacy policy.

1. Camera access: capture photos for messages.
2. Photo library/storage access: choose and import media or files.
3. Microphone access: voice input when enabled.

You can revoke permissions at any time in system settings, but related features may stop working.

## 5. Sharing and disclosure

1. We do not sell your data.
2. We do not share your data.
3. Since we do not hold your user data, disclosure of your data by us is generally not applicable.

2. Data stored on your device is controlled and deleted by you.
3. Data sent to third-party providers follows each provider's own retention policy.
