# Conversation and Context Management

## Organize conversations by task

Do not put every request in one thread.

- Thread A: Product planning
- Thread B: Code implementation
- Thread C: Copywriting polish

This reduces context contamination.

## Stability strategy for long sessions

1. Keep one goal per message.
2. Repeat critical constraints once, such as "must output JSON."
3. Start a new thread when context gets too long, and include a short summary in the first message.

## Prompt structure that works well

Use this order:

1. Background
2. Target output
3. Constraints (format/length/style)
4. Example (optional)

## Regression checks after upgrades

Keep a small fixed test set for quality checks:

- One factual QA prompt
- One structured output prompt (JSON)
- One long-summary prompt

## Local data and privacy

BotHub is local-first for the app experience.  
However, when you call an online model, message content is still sent to the model provider.  
Review provider policy and compliance requirements before sending sensitive data.
