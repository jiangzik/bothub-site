# Provider and Model Configuration

## Core fields

| Field | Purpose | Common mistakes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Base URL` | Provider endpoint | Wrong protocol/path |
| `API Key` | Authentication credential | Partial copy, expired key |
| `Model ID` | Target model | Typo or unavailable model |

## Recommended setup strategy

1. Configure at least two models (primary + backup).
2. Save models separately even under one provider.
3. Name models by workload, such as "writing-longform" or "coding-fast".

## Troubleshooting order

1. Check whether the API key is still valid.
2. Verify model ID in the provider console.
3. Verify Base URL format and path.
4. Check proxy/firewall restrictions.

## Parameter guidance

- Temperature:
  - Lower for factual QA
  - Higher for creative writing
- Max output tokens:
  - Too small causes truncation
  - Too large may increase latency and cost

## Security guidance

- Do not commit API keys to public repos
- Rotate keys regularly, especially in team workflows
- Revoke and recreate immediately if exposed
