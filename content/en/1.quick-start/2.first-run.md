# First Launch and First Message

## Goal

Complete this full flow:

1. Configure a provider
2. Select a model
3. Send a message and receive a reply

## Step 1: Prepare your API key

Create an API key in your provider console and store it securely.  
Creating a dedicated key for BotHub is recommended for easier rotation.

## Step 2: Add a provider

1. Open BotHub Settings.
2. Find the provider/model configuration entry (name may vary by version).
3. Fill in:
   - `Base URL` (if required by provider)
   - `API Key`
   - `Model ID`
4. Save the configuration.

## Step 3: Select your default model

In the conversation area or model selector, choose the model you just configured.

## Step 4: Send a test message

Try: `Hello, introduce yourself in one sentence.`  
If you receive a valid text response, your first run is complete.

## Success criteria

- No authentication errors (401/403)
- No model-not-found errors (404 or invalid model ID)
- Response latency is acceptable and output is readable

## Recommended next actions

- Add one backup model
- Keep a note of valid model IDs to avoid typo errors
- Keep one "smoke test" conversation for post-upgrade checks
